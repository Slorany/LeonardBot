        message.channel.send('**Welcome to the /r/Conlangs Discord Server!**\nAs the title suggests, this is an unofficial server for the /r/Conlangs subreddit. Here you may ask questions to learn more about conlanging, get feedback on your own work, and even find people to collaborate with. However, our server isn\'t strictly conlanging-focused—rather, it may make sense to think of it as a place for conlangers, not just a place for conlanging.  We have a wide variety of channels spanning many different topics (some which are only available on request) making it possible for like-minded people in the conlanging community to communicate and talk about the things that interest them.\nWe hope you enjoy your time here!\n\nBest,\n**The /r/Conlangs Discord Staff**');

        message.channel.send('Note that, in all cases except rule 8, **mod discretion** may apply.');
        message.channel.send('**1. No spam.**\nThis includes but is not limited to continuous nonsensical messages, pointless walls of text, huge conversations in languages other than English (unless in relevant channels), excessively abusing the bot functions, overusing @mentions, and distracting sounds in voice chat. This (minus @mentions, which are always obnoxious) does not apply in <#240224779255152641>.\n**2. No harassment.**\nThis should be pretty clear — threatening someone, continuously trying to anger or upset someone, gaslighting or lying to someone with malicious intent, and so on.\n**3. No discriminatory or insulting comments.**\nJokes are okay as long as it\'s clear you\'re joking and you don\'t take them too far.');
        message.channel.send('**4. No inciting drama.**\nDon\'t say things just for the sake of riling people up. Keep the edge to yourself, don\'t escalate situations beyond what is necessary. If you have a personal issue with someone, take it up with them in private or ask a mod for help. Don\'t spread it into the chat, and definitely don\'t bring it onto the subreddit.\n**5. No inappropriate or disturbing content**\nsuch as pornography or gore. NSFW content in general is strongly discouraged. We also discourage things like jumpscares on the sole reason that they\'re annoying as fuck.\n**6. Stop if someone asks you to stop.**\nAccidents and disagreements happen, and we\'re usually pretty forgiving at first. But if someone\'s continuously asking, don\'t keep pushing your luck — they probably have a pretty good reason. On the other hand, don\'t abuse this rule to get what you want: this isn\'t a *magic word* you can use to guide the course of the conversation.');
        message.channel.send('**7. Repeatedly leaving and joining the server is a most serious offense.** \nTaking a break is okay (please warn us ahead of time), but ragequitting is an annoyance for all of us, members and mods alike, creating unnecessary drama and work.\n**8. Contact the mods.**\nWhether it be rules directly being broken or just confusion about what\'s going on, you can bring us to the situation at hand by mentioning **@Mod**, summoning us in #meta, or just messaging one of us individually. It\'d also be very helpful to specify the channel in question and take screencaps.\n**9. All rules above are subject to mod discretion.**\nRepeatedly breaking the same rule is especially subject to discretion.');
